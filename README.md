# Object Replacer with OneFormer and Stable Diffusion

An AI-powered image editing tool that automatically detects and replaces specific objects in an image using semantic segmentation (OneFormer) and inpainting (Stable Diffusion). Users can interactively define the object to be replaced and provide a natural language prompt for what it should become â€” enabling photorealistic, high-quality transformations.
